Its original mandate was to “grow an open ecosystem for decentralized storage” and to “give developers an open and sustainable platform to build, enhance and monetize those services.”<br /><br />Filecoin Foundation (FF) is an independent organization that facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds critical development projects, supports the growth of Filecoin ecosystem, and advocates for Filecoin and the decentralized web. FF does this by coordinating and supporting the creation and improvement of open-source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.<br /><br />Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) focuses on charitable activities related to preserving important datasets, such as building and supporting the decentralized web community, funding research and development, and educating the public about the decentralized web.<br /><br />"
