        "description": "<p>The Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is launching a request for proposals (RFP) to identify the most compelling initiatives to partner with in three key areas: <ul><li><strong>Creator and Developer Training</strong> — We are interested in proposals for two aspects of creator and developer training. First, empower and inform the next generation of creators and developers, currently in education or in junior roles, so that they can understand, and adopt decentralized technology into their work and lives. Second, give existing Internet developers the tools they need to incorporate decentralized technology into their work. <em>(Up to $1.75M per year)</em></li><li><strong>Public education</strong> — Introduce the public to the decentralized web. These programs should inform diverse global audiences about the values, benefits, and compelling use cases of decentralized technologies. <em>(Up to $100,000 per year)</em></li><li><strong>Universities and GLAM <em>(galleries, libraries, archives, and museums)</em> Institutions</strong> — Drive the development and use of technologies to enable a global decentralized library for all. Projects in this area might pursue efforts such as industry-specific platforms that make uploading information to decentralized storage user-friendly and accessible. <em>(Up to $800,000 per year)</em></li></ul></p><p>If your project or initiative would be a good fit for any of these areas, submit a completed <a href='/FFDW-proposal-narrative-template-2022.zip' alt='FFDW proposal template'>proposal template</a> by the dates listed below. Please submit your full proposal (including attachments) in Word document(s) if possible. Let us know if you have any questions!
